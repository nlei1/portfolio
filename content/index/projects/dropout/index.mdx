As my final project for an AI/ML class in high school, I worked on applying various ML models to data from the Massachusetts Department of Education and discussing the limitations and ethical/practical considerations of ML applications. Throughout this project, I practiced joining different datasets, performing EDAs, running different models, and communicating ideas about AI/ML ethics.
