Envision started out as a data analytics project for the Harvard Data Analytics Group summer fellowship; my team and I wanted to gain helpful insights about traffic safety through visualizing datasets containing data. After merging different data sets, cleaning the data and performing EDAs, we trained a Random Forest Regression model with the data. We then pickled the model and turned it into a web app that allows users to enter custom data like day, month, temperature, etc and receive predictions related to traffic accidents. This project is still in development and we are hoping to geohash longitude and latitude data and create a geospatial ML model.
