I cofounded a summer preview program focused on helping students of traditionally underrepresented backgrounds in STEM succeed in AP level CS courses at my school. As part of that project, I co-led our team in working with district and school administrators, writing lesson plans and lab materials, recruiting students, finding guest speakers, and delivering lessons; a significant part of our two week curriculum was inspired by some of the core topics discussed in MIT Media Lab Lifelong Kindergarten Group's Learning Creative Learning online course (see link below!).
